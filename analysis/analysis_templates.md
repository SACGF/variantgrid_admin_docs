# Analysis - templates

Any user can create an analysis template, but only administrators can make them "official" and appear as links (on the sample/Cohort page etc)

This is done at an Template Version level - edit via admin at eg https://variantgrid.com/admin/analysis/analysistemplateversion/

You can alter the following check boxes:

* Appears in autocomplete
* Appears in links
* Requires sample somatic
* Requires sample gene list
